<h1>Covid-19 Dashboard</h1>
<p>This project is aimed at developing a dashboard web application which displays statistics related to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Accurate, timely data is a key tool in statesâ€™ efforts to understand and respond to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. There have also been increasing calls to further break down COVID-10 data into subcategories (such as by gender, age, and race and ethnicity) in order to track the impact of the disease on specific populations. These dashboards are designed to organize complex data in an easy-to-digest visual format, allowing the audience to easily interpret key trends and patterns at a glance </p>
<p>The dataset being used is operated by the Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). Also, Supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL).
